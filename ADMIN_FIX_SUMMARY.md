# Admin Dashboard Fix Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Issue:** Missing navigation items and 403 Forbidden error on admin dashboard

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Missing Navigation Items
- **User Management** link was not in the sidebar
- **Pregnancy** link was not in the sidebar
- Routes existed in App.jsx but weren't accessible via navigation

### 2. 403 Forbidden Error
- Admin permissions were not properly set in the database
- Existing admin accounts created before permissions system was added
- Missing `canViewAnalytics` permission causing dashboard to fail

---

## Fixes Applied

### Frontend (Maternal_Hub)

#### ✅ AdminLayout.jsx
**Location:** `/src/components/layout/AdminLayout.jsx`

Added missing navigation items to sidebar:
```javascript
<NavItem to="/admin/users">
  <Users size={20} />
  <span>User Management</span>
</NavItem>

<NavItem to="/admin/pregnancy">
  <Heart size={20} />
  <span>Pregnancy</span>
</NavItem>
```

**Navigation Menu Now Shows:**
1. Dashboard
2. Appointments
3. User Management ← **NEW**
4. Pregnancy ← **NEW**
5. Create Admin (super_admin only)

---

### Backend (Maternal_Server)

#### ✅ Created Migration Script
**File:** `/scripts/fixAdminPermissions.js`

- Automatically updates all existing admin permissions
- Sets proper permissions based on admin role
- Ensures all admins have required permissions

**Permissions Set:**
```javascript
{
  canViewUsers: true,
  canEditUsers: true (for admin/super_admin),
  canDeleteUsers: true (for super_admin only),
  canViewAnalytics: true,
  canManageHospitals: true,
  canManageContent: true (for admin/super_admin)
}
```

#### ✅ Updated createAdmin.js
**File:** `/scripts/createAdmin.js`

- Now updates permissions when admin already exists
- Previously only updated email/password
- Ensures role is set correctly

---

## Execution Results

### Migration Successful
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
Found 2 admin(s) in database

✅ Permissions updated for: admin@maternalhub.rw
✅ Permissions updated for: brucenshuti2@gmail.com

✅ All admin permissions updated successfully!
```
