# Deployment Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
The production app at https://maternalhub.vercel.app was unable to connect to the backend because:
1. Frontend was trying to connect to `localhost:3001` instead of production backend
2. Backend on Render (free tier) goes to sleep after inactivity, causing 10-second timeout errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend Fixes (Maternal_Hub)

#### a. Created `.env.production`
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://maternal-server.onrender.com
```
- This ensures Vercel builds use the production backend URL
- Committed to repository (safe to commit, contains only public URLs)

#### b. Fixed `vercel.json`
- Removed invalid properties that were causing deployment errors
- Kept only the necessary rewrites configuration

#### c. Increased API Timeout
- Changed from 10 seconds to 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- File: `src/utils/api.js`
- Allows time for Render backend to wake up from sleep

### 2. Backend Fixes (Maternal_Server)

#### a. Created Keep-Alive Service
- File: `utils/keepAlive.js`
- Automatically pings the backend every 14 minutes
- Prevents Render from putting the service to sleep
- Only runs in production environment

#### b. Updated `server.js`
- Integrated keep-alive service
- Activates automatically when `NODE_ENV=production` or `RENDER` env var is set

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Frontend deployed: https://maternalhub.vercel.app
- Backend deployed: https://maternal-server.onrender.com
- Correct API URL configured in production build
- Keep-alive service will activate after Render redeploys

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Wait for Render to auto-deploy the backend changes (~5 minutes)
- After deployment, the keep-alive service will start automatically
- Backend will stay awake and respond faster

## Testing

### Test Backend Health
```bash
curl https://maternal-server.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Maternal Health API is running",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T...",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### Test Frontend Login
1. Go to https://maternalhub.vercel.app/login
2. Enter credentials
3. First login after backend sleep may take 30-60 seconds (one-time)
4. Subsequent logins should be fast (< 2 seconds)

## Long-term Recommendations

### Option 1: Upgrade Render Plan
- Paid plans don't sleep
- Faster response times
- Better for production use

### Option 2: Use Alternative Backend Hosting
- Railway.app (has free tier with better uptime)
- Fly.io (free tier available)
- Heroku (paid)

### Option 3: Keep Current Setup
- Keep-alive service will maintain uptime
- First request after 15+ minutes of inactivity may be slow
- Acceptable for MVP/demo purposes

## Files Modified

### Frontend (Maternal_Hub)
- `.env.production` (created)
- `.gitignore` (updated to allow .env.production)
- `vercel.json` (simplified)
- `src/utils/api.js` (increased timeout)

### Backend (Maternal_Server)
- `utils/keepAlive.js` (created)
- `server.js` (integrated keep-alive)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Frontend changes deployed to Vercel
2. ‚úÖ Backend changes pushed to GitHub
3. ‚è≥ Wait for Render auto-deployment (~5 minutes)
4. üß™ Test login functionality
5. üìä Monitor backend logs in Render dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### If login still times out:
1. Check Render dashboard - ensure backend is running
2. Check Render logs for errors
3. Manually restart backend service in Render dashboard
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for backend to fully start
5. Try login again

### If backend keeps sleeping:
1. Verify `NODE_ENV=production` is set in Render environment variables
2. Check Render logs to confirm keep-alive service started
3. Look for log message: "üîÑ Keep-alive service started"

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Check Vercel logs: https://vercel.com/dashboard
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
